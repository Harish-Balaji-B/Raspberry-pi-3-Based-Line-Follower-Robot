# Raspberry pi 3 Based Line Follower Robot

### Requirements

* Python
* Colab
* HTML

### Explanation
The Line Follower Robot using Raspberry Pi 3 and L298N motor is a project aimed at developing an autonomous robot capable of following a line on a track. The Raspberry Pi 3 serves as the main controller, while the L298N motor driver is used to control the motors for precise movement. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the integration of hardware and software components to create an efficient line-following robot.

### Components Used
* Raspberry Pi 3
* IR Sensor (2)
* DC Gear Motor (2)
* JUMPER WIRES
* L298n Motor Driver
* Chaises (robot body)
